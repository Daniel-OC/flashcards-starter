## Overview

This application will allow the user to study flashcards from their command line. It can work for any set of cards provided with the requisite parts, but is currently set up for a student studying for Mod2 of the Turing School of Software & Design.

## Still in Progress!
At this point in time the project remains unfinished. I have a couple remaining holes in my understanding the project assembly. I'm reaching out to others for insight and hope to patch those holes up over the weekend.

## Setup
- Clone this repository down to your local machine
- Navigate into the `flashcards-starter` directory
- It is unclear to me how the game runs at this point in time, this will hopefully be corrected this weekend
   
## Links
- The repo lives [here](https://github.com/Daniel-OC/flashcards-starter) 
- Checkout the Turing spec sheet [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/flash-cards.html)
  
## Future Additions
- Figure out how to play the game
- Finish the game accordingly
- Clean up testing suites
